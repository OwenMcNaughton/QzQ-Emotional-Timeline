# whats this

Go to http://owenmcnaughton.github.io/QzQ-Emotional-Timeline and paste a
screenplay or a book (or a bunch of screenplays from like a franchise or
something) and then press some buttons. You'll get trend graphs that hopefully
provide an insight into whats goes on in that film.

If you need to put in markers so that you can correlate events in the film with
conspicuous bumps in the graph, stick in a " \<qzq>empire_strikes_back\</qzq> "
yolk. Those spaces before and after the tags are integral.
